### Hi there 👋

I am **Pratyay Dhond** and it's amazing to have you here!
- I am a learning enthusiast who's always up for new challenges and learning. (Why does learning even have to stop? duhh!)
- I am more into backend development and writing safer, cleaner code. But don't want to restrict myself to that and I am open for projects and gaining experience across all CS domains!
- I am currently reading about **System Design** and planning to read more about writing efficient tests.
- I am a Free Software Enthusiast and a strong believer in KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE FREE!
- Checkout my Linkedin for more activity and recent posts!
- I recently started working on [**Kindle Clippings**](https://kindle-clippings.pages.dev/) - A simple yet efficient way to organise and access kindle highlights - anytime, anywhere!
